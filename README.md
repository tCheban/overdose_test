1) Don`t show popup after close in site (could be applyed with cookies or Local Storage)
2) Placeholder don`t changed because using default newsletter .phtml (Right implementation create new form with input and updated text)

4) Aligns could be wrong because styles moved from image.
5) Don`t included new font for text.
